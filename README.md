# dp-api-dotnet-core-apikey-filter
TODO - I will add more docs here. But I have just updated this to not use the asp.net mvc filter anymore as I've taken a new approach with core 6, also shown here, where much of the code is from https://jasonwatmore.com/post/2022/02/18/net-6-role-based-authorization-tutorial-with-example-api 

The API key management APIs are not in place here, just the database table. This just deals with the Auth Attribute for putting an API key in the header x-api-key and passing a user object back to the controler from the middleware.

This is just a quick check-in
